# Airbnb-Project-Analysis
Airbnb Project Analysis (Tableau + ETL)

**📊 Overview**

This project explores the Airbnb dataset to uncover insights into property listings, pricing trends, and revenue performance. By performing ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes for data cleaning and preparation, the dataset was integrated into Tableau to build an interactive dashboard that aids in strategic decision-making for property hosts and stakeholders.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies**

ETL Tools – Data cleaning and transformation using SQL and Python.

Tableau – Dashboard creation and visualization.


**💼 Business Problem Statement**

The objective is to provide actionable insights into Airbnb property listings by answering key questions:

What is the average price per bedroom?

How does pricing vary by zip code?

What are the yearly revenue trends?

How many distinct property listings are there based on the number of bedrooms?

The insights derived will help property hosts optimize pricing, maximize revenue, and better understand regional market trends.


**📈 Dashboard Features (Tableau)**

Bar Chart: Displaying the average price per bedroom, categorized by the number of bedrooms.

Table: Showing the distinct count of bedroom listings per room type (e.g., Entire home/apt, Private room, Shared room).

Line Chart: Illustrating the yearly revenue trend for Airbnb listings.

Bar Graph (Color-Coded): Visualizing the price distribution by zip code, segmented by different price ranges.

Map (Color-Coded): Highlighting the average price per zip code for geographical analysis.

These visualizations offer a comprehensive view of pricing dynamics, regional differences, and revenue trends, supporting data-driven decision-making.
